Technical Analysis Report: Nmap SYN Scan Detection
1. Attack Execution Summary
Attack Source: Kali Linux (\texttt{192.168.100.20})

Target: Metasploitable 2 (\texttt{192.168.100.10})

Command Used: The attack traffic was generated by a half-open SYN scan: \texttt{nmap -sS 192.168.100.10}

Capture Method: Wireshark was executed directly within the Kali Attacker VM, capturing traffic on the \texttt{eth0} interface in the Internal Network.

2. Detection Methodology (Wireshark)
The goal was to isolate the incomplete three-way handshake attempts, which characterize a stealth scan, differentiating them from normal network traffic.

Display Filter Used:
\texttt{ip.src == 192.168.100.20 and tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0}

Filter Logic: This isolates packets originating from the Attacker, where the TCP Synchronization flag (\texttt{SYN}) is set (to initiate a connection) and the Acknowledgment flag (\texttt{ACK}) is clear (to prevent the connection from completing).

Forensic Finding:
The filter successfully revealed a massive volume of packets where only the SYN flag was set. This signature confirms the detection of a Stealth Port Scan, a reconnaissance technique used by attackers to probe for open ports without leaving a complete connection record in the victim's logs.

3. Evidence Included
\texttt{kalitometa.pcapng}: The raw packet capture file, confirming the successful forensic analysis.
